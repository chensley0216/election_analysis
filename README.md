Election Audit Summary:

While the data only pertained to select counties, the script used for this particular event can be expanded to handle other types of elections-related data.  By modifying the code, this could determine winners in elections for entire states, and compare several counties at once.  This could also be taken to a nationwide level by selecting winners based on statewide data.
